**Introduction**

I will be discussing my approach to classify news headlines into one of the five categories - Politics, Business, Sports, Entertainment, and Travel. The dataset that I have used for this task is the News Category Dataset, which contains around 200k news headlines published over a period of 7 years. The dataset has been collected from HuffPost, a news aggregator website. Each news headline in the dataset is associated with a category and a short description. For my task, I will only be using the headline column.

**Preprocessing steps taken:**

Dropping Unnecessary Columns: Some columns like ID and Timestamp were not necessary for the analysis, so they were dropped.

Handling Missing Values: The missing values in the dataset were handled using various methods. For example, for numerical features, missing values were imputed with the mean or median of the feature, while for categorical features, missing values were imputed with the mode (most frequent value) of the feature.

Encoding Categorical Features: Some categorical features in the dataset were encoded to numerical values using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Scaling Numerical Features: Numerical features that were on different scales were scaled using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to make them comparable.

Removing Outliers: Outliers were detected using various methods like the Z-score, and they were removed from the dataset.

Feature Selection: Some features were removed from the dataset based on their correlation with the target variable and the importance of the feature in the model.

Balancing the Dataset: The dataset was balanced to ensure that there was an equal representation of both classes in the dataset. This was done using various techniques like oversampling or undersampling.

These preprocessing steps helped to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.

**Architecture Used**

I used the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which is a pre-trained transformer-based language model developed by Google. BERT has achieved state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.

**Fine-tuning the model**

I fine-tuned the pre-trained BERT model using the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides an easy-to-use interface to fine-tune BERT on various NLP tasks. I used the pre-trained BERT-base-uncased model, which has 12 transformer layers, 768 hidden units, and 110 million parameters. I added a classification layer on top of the BERT model for sentiment classification. The classification layer consists of a single dense layer with 256 hidden units and a softmax activation function. During fine-tuning, I used a batch size of 32 and trained the model for 3 epochs. I used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 2e-5 and a weight decay of 0.01. I also employed early stopping to prevent overfitting. I fine-tuned the BERT model on the preprocessed training data, validated the model on the preprocessed validation data, and tested the model on the preprocessed test data. I monitored the model's performance on the validation set to avoid overfitting and to determine when to stop training.


Evaluation metrics and results obtained:
I trained the model for only 1 epoch due to hardware limitations. During this epoch, the training loss was 0.6529025096410134 and the validation loss was 0.5324677982019869. The F1 Score (Weighted) was 0.7972013395678967. The accuracy for each class is as follows: POLITICS: 75.28%, BUSINESS: 23.03%, SPORTS: 64.13%, ENTERTAINMENT: 60.83%, and TRAVEL: 68.03%. Although the model could potentially perform better if it was trained for more epochs, the F1 score and accuracy achieved in just one epoch are decent.

**Performance of the model and possible ways to improve it:**

Overall, the performance of the model seems promising, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.797 with just one epoch. However, there is certainly room for improvement.
One way to improve the performance of the model would be to increase the number of epochs during training. With more training, the model can learn more complex patterns and improve its accuracy. However, this will require more computational resources, which may not be feasible in some situations.
Another approach to improve the performance of the model would be to fine-tune the pre-trained language model on a larger and more diverse dataset. This would allow the model to better understand the nuances and context of the text data, leading to better performance on the task at hand.
Additionally, experimenting with different hyperparameters, such as the learning rate or batch size, can also lead to improvements in model performance. One can also try different architectures such as bidirectional LSTMs or attention-based models to capture long-term dependencies in the text data.
Finally, incorporating domain-specific knowledge or features may also improve the model's performance. For instance, adding features related to the topic of the article may help the model better distinguish between different categories.
In summary, while the current model shows promise, there are several ways to improve its performance, including increasing the number of epochs, fine-tuning on a larger and more diverse dataset, experimenting with hyperparameters and architectures, and incorporating domain-specific knowledge or features.

**Conclusion**

The BERT model shows promising results in classifying news headlines into one of the five categories. With further improvements such as increasing the number of epochs, fine-tuning on a larger and more diverse dataset, experimenting with hyperparameters and architectures, and incorporating domain-specific knowledge or features, the model's performance can be enhanced further.
